# Data-Driven-stock-Analysis
"A data-driven analysis of Nifty 50 stocks using Python and visualization tools (Matplotlib, Streamlit, Power BI) to uncover market trends, volatility, sector performance, and top movers."

This project presents a comprehensive, data-driven analysis of Nifty 50 stocks. Starting with YAML data, 
it was transformed into 50 structured CSV files for individual stocks. Using Python (Pandas, Matplotlib), key analyses were performed including:

Volatility and cumulative returns tracking
Sector-wise performance evaluation
Monthly top gainers and losers
Stock price correlation via heatmaps

Visualizations were created using Matplotlib, and the insights were brought to life through interactive dashboards in Streamlit and Power BI.
The project adheres to clean coding practices, includes data validation, and is fully documented for clarity and reproducibility.
